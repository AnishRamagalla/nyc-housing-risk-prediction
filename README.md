This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts housing quality risks in New York city, using publicly available data from NYC open data. The model will identify which buildings are most likely to develop serious housing violations (such as mold, heating issues, or rodent infestations).
Unlike existing dashboards that only show past complaints, this project focuses on:
predicting future housing risks,
auditing fairness across neighborhoods,
Explaining predictions using interpretable AI methods.

Objectives:
Predictive modeling - Train ML models on 311 complaints and housing violation data.
Fairness Analysis - Investigate if predictions are biased against certain neighborhoods or demographics
Interpretability - Apply SHAP/LIME to explain why a property is flagged as "high-risk".

Datasets
NYC 311 Service requests
NYC HPD Housing Maintanence Code Violations
NYC DOB Complaints
NYC Neighborhood Demographics
All Data is available publicly in NYC Open Data

Tech Stack
Python (pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn)
Machine Learning (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression)
Explainability (SHAP, LIME)
Visualization (Matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly)
Collaboration & writing: Jupyter Notebooks, Overleaf(Latex), GitHub

Expected Outcomes
A trained ML model that flags high-risk housing units in NYC
fairness audit results across different boroughs/neighborhoods
Interpretable explanations of model predictions
